# BartenderApp_Removal_of_Else_statements

This program asks what drink the user would like to get. If the user is over 18 they can order an alcoholic beverage, else they are welcome to some soda.<br /> 
The **OOP** is implemented and the program is structured the way to **omit** the use of **"else"** statement and **extra indentations**.
